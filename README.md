## Overview

Hello, Jordon here! 

This is my first project that I've done with FrontEnd Mentor and I'm really happy with the results! It's a simple one but it shows that I've been learning and that's all the motivation I need to keep moving forward. I look forward to looking back at this in 2, 4, 10 years time to see how far I've come.

## My process

I started with doing what I felt was the easier things first and then went on to break down the bigger things. The thing that was the most satisfying was creating the container and actually aligning the QR image properly in it. CSS Positioning is the thing I'm finding the hardest to wrap my head around. I never know which way to tackle them. Flexbox might be my biggest enemy so far. But I figured it out and everything else was simple enough.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
